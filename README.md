## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

NASA, one of the biggest civilian space agencies, was created to benefit humanity and protect our planet earth the earth though scientific exploration and discovery. This being said, it is crucial to identify any object that can potentially impact the Earth. The list collected from Sentry, NASA’s collision monitoring system, allows us to identify the classification and probability of an asteroid hitting the Earth. Questions that come to mind, and can hopefully be answered after some exploratory data analysis are, In which year is Earth most likely to be impacted by an asteroid and How do the predictions of asteroid impacts change over time? We also want to look at which asteroid would cause the most impact based on their speed and size. Overall, we are interested in this dataset, as we will be able to explore how close asteroids have come to hitting the earth.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our group decided to analyze a data set on asteroid impacts, more specifically, their probability and classification. This data was collected by NASA’s Near Earth Object Program at the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). This program features data calculated by Sentry, NASA’s collision monitoring system, which scans for possible asteroids that could impact the Earth in the next 100 years. The list produced by Sentry of all possible asteroids and their impact to the earth is what we will be using as our data.
The data is separated by asteroid name and each of their corresponding characteristics, such as asteroid magnitude and velocity, maximum and cumulative Palermo Scale, and period start and end date etc. Our group chose this dataset because we believe that it would be an interesting topic of analysis and it fell within the requirements needed for a strong dataset. We look forward to learning how to apply our knowledge from this course to such an interesting topic.
